IMU:
Files for all that deal with the IMU are kept
here.

Includes all .cpp and .h files which 
conveniently wrap the Adafruit files for easy
use in the Main sketch.

Must use "" instead of <> to reference local
copies rather than ones in /libraries/.

Includes a test sketch to ensure that the IMU
is doing the thing correctly.

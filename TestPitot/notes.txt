Place 100nF (#104) capacitor connecting V and Gnd.

Runs in the following conditions:
Addr: 0x28 for MS4525DO
5V logic arduino: (OSEPP Uno)
    5V supply and 3V supply

Does not run in following:
3.3V logic arduino: (Teensy)
    3.3 supply
    Will hang on Wire.endTransmission()
    Return code 4 if it gets past that
*/
Is capacitor needed?

Put resistor somewhere?
Did I have to keep address as byte?
- removed the cast to int in Wire.requestFrom()




What is going wrong:
The Arduino may hang during I2C communication.
It occurs after beginTransmission(), and before
endTransmission().
